        "## Intro\n",
        "\n",
        "What is this? Sample code and walkthrough of a Physical Symbol System -- a virtual one, of course. My Python is rusty, so I asked ChatGPT to write me some of the first few (simple) chunks of Python code used below. I checked and cleaned them. The second half of the code is more me writing from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: All code chunks must be run in order. Rerunning chunks in different orders might change results, because variables get be redefined with new input.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Physical Symbol Systems\n",
        "\n",
        "In 1975, Herbert Simon and Allen Newell proposed the *physical symbol system hypothesis*: A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means for general intelligent action. They defined a physical symbol system as a physical device or other physical system:\n",
        "1. with physical patterns (the symbols)\n",
        "2. that can be combined to form complex symbol structures\n",
        "3. such that the system contains processes or mechanisms for manipulating those complex symbol structures\n",
        "4. and such that the processes for generating and transforming those complex symbol structures can themselves be represented by complex symbol structures within the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "Simon and Newell don't have a precise definition of \"intelligent action\", but instead think of it on the model of problem solving via a search space.\n",
        "\n",
        "## River Crossing Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "This CoLab will simulate a physical symbol system (PSS), using Python, which demonstrates \"intelligent action\" by solving one version of the *River Crossing Problem*. The problem goes: Kirk, Spock, and McCoy (three officers) and three “red shirts” are on one side of a river with a small boat that holds at most two people. Gorn are lurking on both river banks, and if one or two of the red shirts ever finds themselves outnumbered by officers (“odd ones out”), the Gorn attack. How can all six get to the other side of the river without inviting a Gorn attack? (This version of the problem is inspired by chapter 4 of [Bermúdez's textbook, _Cognitive Science_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/resources/cognitive-science-4/).)\n",
        "\n",
        "We can think of the problem as involving an initial state, a solution state, and a set of constraints on how to get from one to the other. The initial state is all six people on one bank, the solution state is all six on the opposite bank, the constraints are that only at most two people can fit in the boat, someone always has to pilot the boat across the river (of course), and if there are red shirts on a bank, they can’t be outnumbered by officers.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "**Manipulation Processes:** Move at least one and at most two other characters and the b to the opposite side of the /, such that if there’s an r on a side of the /, the number of o never exceeds the number of r on that side.\n",

        "The above solution used a brute-force method to solve the problem. In essence, it randomly searches all possible paths in the \"crossing space\" until it finds a crossing which solves the problem. Because it's random, the solutions it finds are normally longer (more crossings) than a person could devise with reason, and it often takes many tries until it finds a solution, because its random selection often leads it into dead ends in which a red shirt is always left outnumbered by officers. (For example, I solved the problem by hand in 12 crossings, as outlined in the lecture slides.)\n",

        "To ensure we have 15 or fewer crossings, we will simply set the solution_finder so that it exits as a failed attempt if there are more than 15 crossings.\n",
        "\n",
        "More importantly, we will now set a heuristic rule, one for how to handle crossing left-to-right, and one for how to handle crossing right-to-left. In English, the heuristics we'll use are:\n",
