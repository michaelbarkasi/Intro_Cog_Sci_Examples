# Intro_Cog_Sci_Examples
Simulations of physical symbol systems and neural networks for my Intro to Cog Sci and other courses.

PNP_200_Sample_PSS_River_Crossing_Problem.ipynb
> A simple "physical symbol system" (in the style of Simon and Newell) which is programed to solve a version of the river crossing problem using heuristics.

PNP_200_Single_Layer_Network_and_Perceptron_Learning.ipynb
> A single-layer neural network (a single neuron, i.e. "perceptron") trained using Rosenblatt's Perceptron Convergence Rule to become an AND gate, and also to learn a new random set of input weights. Uses four different threshold activation functions. 

Deep_Neural_Network_Sample_Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb
> A simple deep neural network (one hidden layer) trained to sentiment analysis on IMBd movie reviews.
